# BOUNCE
A peggle-like game for the TI84+CE

# Tutorial

Move around the "Spitter" (the thing in the top center of the screen) using the arrow keys. This is how you aim it. You can throw from it using the "2nd" key. Hitting the pins on the screen increases your score and also the more you hit in a row, the higher the score increases for each next one you hit. You start with 20 pinballs, your pinballs increase by 3 for each level you complete. You can view the 'guidence' for the ball by pressing the "Mode" button. This will show you where your pinball will go and what pins will be hit without wasting a ball. You use up one guide, which is shown in the bottom right, for each time you use the power. You can get more guides by getting a streak of 5, then for each successive hit, you gain one guide.
